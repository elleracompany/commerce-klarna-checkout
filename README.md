4.  Navigate to `Commerce -> System Settings -> Gateways` and `+ New Gateway`

6.  Set your information Playground credentials in API Credentials Europe Test Username (UID)/Test Password.
7.  Get Klarna Production Approval for your site
8.  Turn off "Testing Mode" and add production credentials for the Gateway


#### Payment button
Since Klarna is rendering its own payment button, the craft-commerce default 'Pay' button must be removed.
You can copy and overwrite your shop default `checkout/payment.html` file with `vendor/ellera/commerce-klarna-checkout/src/templates/pages/checkout/payment.html` or simply update your existing template with
```
{% if cart.gateway.handle is not same as('klarna') %}
    <button class="button button-primary" type="submit">Pay {{ cart.totalPrice|commerceCurrency(cart.paymentCurrency,convert=true) }}</button>
{% endif %}
```
#### Get Klarna Approval
You need approval from klarna before you can change to production mode.

#### Klarna Order Complete HTML
To render the Klarna Order Complete HTML you can use this code in your `shop/customer/order` template:
```
    {% if order.gateway.handle is same as('klarna') and order.gateway.hasHtml %}
        {{ order.gateway.getHtml(order.id)|raw }}
    {% else %}
        // Regular thank-you-page
    {% endif %}
```

*Note: The Klarna OrderID is stored in the PHP session and the HTML is fetched from Klarna APIs. `order.gateway.hasHtml` will check that the session exist, and if not you can render the regular thank-you-page.*
#### VAT and Taxes

Klarna requires tax to be sent per order line, not on the order in total, so for VAT and Taxes to be passed along to Klarna correctly, the taxable subject must be set to "Line item price".
If the shipping cost is taxable as well, you need to create a separate tax rate for shipping and set that to "Order total shipping cost"

## Troubleshooting

#### I get 401 or 403 response when I turn off Test Mode
You need approval from Klarna before your account is approved for production.
